Android WebView is generally used to embed a browser in android app to load all the URLs. This ultimately helps to keep the users more engaged within the app, rather than making them leave due to outside links. IÂ’ve also created a demo on [How To Embed Android WebView to Load URLs Inside Android Apps](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-webview-example/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your Android App and looking to [Hire Android App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
